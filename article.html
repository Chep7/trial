            <h2>SEO Benefits</h2>
            <p>Search engines rely on semantic HTML to understand the content and context of web pages. By using semantic elements such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, you provide clear indications of the purpose and hierarchy of different parts of your content.</p>
            <p>Properly structured content makes it easier for search engines to crawl and index your website, leading to improved visibility in search results. Additionally, semantic HTML helps search engines prioritize and understand the relevance of your content, which can positively impact your search engine rankings.</p>
